/**
 * This LayoutManager may arrange Components so that the overlap.
 * <p>
 * This installs a custom RepaintManager to ensure repaints correctly
 * originate from the highest OverlappingLayoutManager.
 * <p>
 * The original use case for this class was: I arranged a JScrollPane
 * with a close button that slightly overlapped one of the scrollbars.
 * When the user interacts with the scrollbar: the JScrollBar would
 * request repaints and would end up painting *over* the button, which
 * was supposed to always float on top. This class solves this problem
 * by passing the repaint request up to the highest ancestor with
 * a OverlappingLayoutManager. This guarantees that the containing
 * panel will paint the appropriate area and all other descendants
 * -- including descendants that should float above the repainted
 * component.
 * <p>
 * This assumes no other entity has already override the RepaintManager,
 * and that no other entity will come along afterward and override this
 * RepaintManager.
