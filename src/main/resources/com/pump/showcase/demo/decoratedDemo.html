<h1>DecoratedListUI, DecoratedTreeUI Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>The <code>DecoratedListUI</code> and <code>DecoratedTreeUI</code> render clickable/animatable icons on rows in lists/trees.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>The demo in this showcase app offers a few ideas for potential decorations.</p>
<p>Each decoration is basically an actionable icon that implements this interface:</p>
<pre>
public interface ListDecoration {

    Icon getIcon(JList list, Object value, int row,
        boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus, boolean isRollover,
        boolean isPressed);

    boolean isVisible(JList list, Object value, int row,
        boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus);

    ActionListener getActionListener(JList list, Object value,
        int row, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus);

    Point getLocation(JList list, Object value, int row,
        boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus);
}
</pre>

<p>And then to integrate it:
<pre>
JList list = new JList();
list.putClientProperty( DecoratedListUI.KEY_DECORATIONS,
    new ListDecoration[] { decoration1, decoration2, etc. });
list.setUI(new DecoratedListUI());
</pre>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The decorations are "stamped" on each row, like the <code>CellRendererPane</code>. That is: they don't exist in the component hierarchy, and the <code>ComponentUI</code> is responsible for interpreting mouse clicks and triggering the appropriate <code>ActionListener</code>.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is great way to add extra functionality for power users without adding too much visual clutter.</p>
<p>However: you need to decide what you want to do about accessibility. This class represents a UI choice that is <em>not</em> accessible. This may be OK <em>if</em> every feature that is part of a decoration is also available somewhere else in your application. For example: if you also have a menu shortcut that activates the same feature.</p>
<p>The alternative is to try to layer actual <code>JComponents</code> into your UI, and that has its own complex set of challenges for a list or a tree.</p>
