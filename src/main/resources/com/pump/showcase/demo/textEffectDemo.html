<h1>TextEffect Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>This models a few different implementations of the <code>TextEffect</code> class.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>The following code creates a simple animation that repeats from 0% to 100% every one second (assuming you continually repaint):</p>
<pre>TextEffect effect = new PunchTextEffect(font, text,
		width, height, fillColor, shadowColor);

float fraction = ((float)(System.currentTimeMillis()%1000)) / 1000f;
effect.paint(g, fraction);
</pre>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The <code>TextEffect</code> interface is roughly modeled after the <a href="resource:transition"><code>Transition</code></a> interface:</p>
<pre>/** This is a common interface for visual text effects. */
public interface TextEffect {

	/**
	 * Paint this effect.
	 * 
	 * @param g
	 *            the Graphics2D to paint to.
	 * @param fraction
	 *            a float from [0, 1] indicating how
	 *            far along this effect it.
	 */
	public void paint(Graphics2D g, float fraction);

	/**
	 * An optional method to retrieve the preferred size.
	 * May return null.
	 */
	public Dimension getPreferredSize();
}</pre>
<p>
These effects started with the <code>CalligraphyStroke</code>. That stroke helped make easy work of the <code>BlockLetter</code> class, which is used to add a simple 3D-ish depth to letters (as seen in the punch and explode effects).
<p>
The outline effect uses the <code>Scribbler</code> class to add a little chaos into the mix.
<p>
The writing effect is a complete departure from everything else. This uses a <code>WritingFont</code> object, which is a font rendered with a constant <code>java.awt.Stroke</code> where the order of each stroke is preserved. This has to be input by hand (I wrote a special editor app to design these). So far I've implemented one font based on <a href="http://comicneue.com/">Comic Neue</a>, and another based on some simple calligraphic tutorials.
<p>
All of these &#8208; especially the writing fonts &#8208; can be improved. To date I haven't deployed these in a commercial project, though, so they're low on my priority list. I have, however, implemented a set of text effect animations for a commercial product (flying in text, flipping text, etc.), but that code/project is not open source.
