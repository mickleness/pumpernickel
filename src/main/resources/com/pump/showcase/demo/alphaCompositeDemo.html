<h1>AlphaComposite Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>This demo shows how different <code>java.awt.AlphaComposites</code> render.</p>
<p>On the rare occasion that I need a composite other than <code>SRC_OVER</code>: sometimes I forget exactly which composite I need. And the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/AlphaComposite.html">AlphaComposite javadoc</a> is great, but the mathematical expression isn't as useful (to me) as just seeing the composites in action.</p>
<p>Most of the demos in this application showcase a novel new piece of code I want to share. But this isn't of those demos. This is just a simple helper class that let's you visually experiment with AlphaComposites.
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>Observe how changing the controls in the "Configuration" panel affect the "Example" panel.</p>
