<h1>AngleSliderUI Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>The <code>AngleSliderUI</code> is a <code>SliderUI</code> that renders the value of a slider as degrees on a circular dial.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>Simply call:</p>
<pre>slider.setUI(new AngleSliderUI());</pre>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Usually I'm a fan of trying to extend the <code>Basic</code> UI classes (in this case: the <code>BasicSliderUI</code>). But this is one of those cases where the UI is so significantly different that I extended the <code>SliderUI</code> instead.</p>
<p>A custom <code>MouseListener</code> and <code>KeyListener</code> control the position of the angle dial, which is mapped to the numerical range of the slider.</p>
<p>(And for non-traditional users who won't use the mouse/keyboard like I do: this <code>SliderUI</code> has no impact on the default <code>AccessibleJSlider</code> behavior that all <code>JSliders</code> automatically share. So in that case it will be beneficial to the user to make sure your slider ranges from, say, 0-359.)</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This was inspired by a widget we saw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWeb">iWeb</a>. (Although I forget exactly what it was used for; I'm sure whatever it was was highly graphical.)</p>
<p>In the last decade I've used it as an editor for shadow angles and rotation. In this app you can see an example of this UI in the <a href="resource:Strokes">Strokes, MouseSmoothing</a> demo.</p>
<p>Many years ago I included an special Aqua variant: the AquaAngleSliderUI. This dated back to ... maybe 2010? Back in those days Aqua <a href="https://512pixels.net/2014/04/aqua-past-future/">still had elements that appeared to resemble candy</a> (bubbly, plastic, shiny). Nowadays both Apple and Microsoft are trending more towards a minimalist design, though, so I think the current UI is a sufficient one-size-fits-all implementation for Mac and Windows.</p>
