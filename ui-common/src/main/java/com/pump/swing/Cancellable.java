/**
 * An interface for operations that can be cancelled.
 * <P>
 * This is useful when two different threads are involved in an operation:
 * Thread A wants to monitor an operation and Thread B is actually performing
 * it. If the user indicates they want to cancel the operation then Thread A
 * calls <code>cancel()</code>. Thread B should be checking the value of
 * <code>isCanceled()</code> regularly, and abort if it returns
 * <code>true</code> (maybe by throwing a <code>UserCanceledException</code>).
 * A lot of projects use {@link Thread#interrupt()} to achieve this basic
 * design goal, but this interface is more explicit regarding exactly what changed.
 * <P>
 * Similarly this tracks a task's "finished" status. Sometimes when Thread B
 * completes an operation it should call <code>finish()</code>, and Thread A
 * can relay this status by regularly checking <code>isFinished()</code>.
