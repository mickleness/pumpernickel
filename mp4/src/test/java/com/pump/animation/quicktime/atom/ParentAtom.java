	 * A single track may reference multiple tracks. For example, a video track
	 * could reference a sound track to indicate that the two are synchronized
	 * and a time code track to indicate where its time code is stored.
	 * <p>

	 * both a sound and video track could reference the same time code track if
	 * they share the same timing information.
