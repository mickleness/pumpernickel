/**
 * This atom represents a range of different IDs that all begin with the "©"
 * character.
 * <p>
 * All user data list entries whose type begins with the © character (ASCII 169)
 * are defined to be international text. These list entries must contain a list
 * of text strings with associated language codes. By storing multiple versions
 * of the same text, a single user data text item can contain translations for
 * different languages.
 * <p>
 * The list of text strings uses a small integer atom format, which is identical
 * to the QuickTime atom format except that it uses 16-bit values for size and
 * type instead of 32-bit values. The first value is the size of the string,
 * including the size and type, and the second value is the language code for
 * the string.
 * <p>
 * User data text strings may use either Macintosh text encoding or Unicode text
 * encoding. The format of the language code determines the text encoding
 * format. Macintosh language codes are followed by Macintosh-encoded text. If
 * the language code is specified using the ISO language codes listed in
 * specification ISO 639-2/T, the text uses Unicode text encoding. When Unicode
 * is used, the text is in UTF-8 unless it starts with a byte-order-mark (BOM,
 * 0xFEFF), in which case the text is in UTF-16. Both the BOM and the UTF-16
 * text should be big-endian. Multiple versions of the same text may use
 * different encoding schemes.
 * <p>
 * Important: Language code values less than 0x400 are Macintosh language codes.
 * Language code values greater than or equal to 0x400 are ISO language codes.
 * The exception to this rule is language code 0x7FFF, which indicates an
 * unspecified Macintosh language.
 * <p>
 * ISO language codes are three-character codes. In order to fit inside a 16-bit
 * field, the characters must be packed into three 5-bit subfields. This packing
 * is described in “ISO Language Codes”.
