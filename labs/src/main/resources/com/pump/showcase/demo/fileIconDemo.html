<h1>FileIcon Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>The <code>FileIcon</code> is an abstract class that creates a <code>javax.swing.Icon</code> for a <code>File</code>.</p>
<p>A file icon is a small (usually about 16x16) icon you can place next to a file name. Usually all files with the same file extension share the same file icon.</p>
<p>An "icon" is different from a "thumbnail". (A thumbnail is an image that is a rendering of a specific file.) And sometimes the word "preview" also carries special implications of interactivity (for ex: a video). So "icon", "thumbnail" and "preview" are all separate buzzwords.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>The simplest one-line invocation resembles:</p>
<pre>Icon icon = FileIcon.get().getIcon(file);</pre>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Each subclass is responsible for deciding how to identify the appropriate icon. And the <code>FileIcon</code> class has a static getter/setter method for maintaining the active default <code>FileIcon</code> on a given system.
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Implementations</h3>
<p>There are currently 2 subclasses of <code>FileIcon</code>. (There used to be a 3rd that involved reflection, but in accordance with Java guidelines I'm trying to phase out reflection.)
<h4>Implementation #1: FileSystemViewFileIcon</h4>
<p>This implementation uses <code>FileSystemView</code>, and it resembles:</p>
<pre>public class FileSystemViewFileIcon extends FileIcon {
	@Override
	public Icon getIcon(File file) {
		FileSystemView fsv = FileSystemView.getFileSystemView();
		Icon icon = fsv.getSystemIcon(file);
		if (icon != null)
			return icon;
		return super.getDefaultIcon(file);
	}
}</pre>
<p>This looks like it should be the ideal way to go, because it's so clean/direct. But on Mac it only ever returns a generic file or folder icon. I tried rummaging through the source code for <code>FileSystemView</code> (and related classes) to see if I could modify (hack) it without reflection, but there aren't a lot of entry points.</p>
<h4>Implementation #2: FileViewFileIcon</h4>
<p>This implementation uses a <code>JFileChooser's</code> <code>FileView</code>, and it resembles:</p>
<pre>public class FileViewFileIcon extends FileIcon {
	FileView fileView;
	public FileViewFileIcon() {
		JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();
		fileView = chooser.getUI().getFileView(chooser);
	}

	@Override
	public Icon getIcon(File file) {
		return fileView.getIcon(file);
	}
}</pre>
<p>I don't like that this is so indirect and clunky. Sometimes creating a <code>JFileChooser</code> is not trivially cheap, either. But on Mac: this works great. It returns scalable icons for most every file type.</p>
<p>On Windows: both this approach and the <code>FileSystemView</code> approach produce unscaleable (kind of crappy/pixelated) 16x16 icons. But today as I wrote this I saw emails trickle in about <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/2875/files">a pull request to update this</a> in future Java versions, so that's exciting.</p>
<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>This demo includes an option to scale the icon.</p>
<p>On Mac the icons we get back are high-resolution, so they can scale to most any size with great clarity.</p>
<p>On Windows the icons are not (yet) high-resolution. (Although in a future Java release that should change.) So if you want a universal cross-platform approach: you ought to just stick with the icon's default size. (And even that, unfortunately, will look pixelated on a high-resolution monitor on Windows.)</p>
