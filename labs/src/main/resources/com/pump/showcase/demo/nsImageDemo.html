<h1>NSImage Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>The <code>com.pump.image.NSImage</code> class identifies several images available only on Mac.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways to access the image titled "Computer":</p>
<pre>Image img1 = NSImage.Computer.getImage();
Image img2 = NSImage.Computer.getImage(new Dimension(64, 64));
BufferedImage img3 = NSImage.Computer.getBufferedImage();
BufferedImage img3 = NSImage.Computer.getBufferedImage(new Dimension(64, 64));</pre>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The default Mac toolkit (the <code>sun.lwawt.macosx.LWCToolkit</code>) has special logic to intercept all requests for images that start with the prefix "NSImage://NS". You don't actually need the <code>com.pump.image.NSImage</code> class to access this feature on Mac; this demo primary exists as a reminder of what images are available.</p>
<p>The fields in NSImage are not meant to be an exhaustive list. You may be able to request some images not listed here.</p>
<p>The images may change from one OS release to another, so it's important that you choose them for their intended usage and not for their actual image.</p>
<p>If you attempt to invoke any NSImages on another platform you may get an exception or an empty image.</p>
