<h1>Stroke, MouseSmoothing Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>This demo features four new <code>java.awt.Strokes</code>, and it discusses the <code>MouseSmoothing</code> interface to smooth out the jagged edges in mouse paths.</p>
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>The strokes are all pretty self-explanatory if you look at their constructors. For example the <code>BristleStroke</code> can be used as follows:</p>
<pre>
float width = 3;
float thickness = .5f;
long randomSeed = 0;
Stroke s = new BristleStroke(width, thickness, randomSeed);
graphics2D.setStroke(s);
</pre>
<p>To smooth out jagged user mouse input you can call:</p>
<pre>MouseSmoothing s = new BasicMouseSmoothing();
for (Point2D p : mousePoints) {
  s.add((float)p.getX(), (float)p.getY(), 0);
}
Shape smoothedShape = s.getShape();
</pre>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<h3>Strokes</h3>
<p>The <code>BristleStroke</code> splatters tiny shapes (like shrapnel) over your path. The frequency of the shapes is a little greater in the middle of the stroke, and it tapers off towards the edges &#8208; depending on the thickness you've designated.</p>
<p>The <code>BrushStroke</code> uses a <code>MeasuredShape</code> to break up the original path into small sections and paint them in streaks.</p>
<p>The <code>CalligraphyStroke</code> emulates a fixed-angle nib tracing a shape.</p>
<p>The <code>CharcoalStroke</code> starts with another Stroke (by default a BasicStroke) and inserts cracks at a fixed angle into that shape.</p>

<h3>MouseSmoothing</h3>
<p>The <code>MouseSmoothing</code> interface models a class that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing">smooths out</a> incoming mouse data:</p>
<pre>public interface MouseSmoothing {
  public void add(float x,float y,long t);
  public void reset();
  public GeneralPath getShape();
  public void getShape(GeneralPath path);
  public boolean isEmpty();
}</pre>
<p>The smoothing toggle in this demo uses the <code>BasicMouseSmoothing</code> class to smooth out your drawings, or (when disabled) it renders the points exactly as the MouseEvents capture them.</p>
<p>The <code>BasicMouseSmoothing</code> class tries to simplify the incoming points and, through trial and error, approximate BÃ©zier curves that are a reasonable fit for the incoming user mouse points.</p>
