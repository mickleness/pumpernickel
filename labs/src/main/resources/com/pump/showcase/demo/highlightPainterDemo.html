<h1>HighlightPainter Demo</h1>
<h2>What Is It</h2>
<p>This demo features two simple new <code>HighlightPainters</code>: the <code>UnderlineHighlightPainter</code> and the <code>TextBoxHighlightPainter</code>.
<h2>How To Use It</h2>
<p>Swing already does all the heavy lifting here for us. We can add these just like any other <code>HighlightPainter</code>:</p>
<pre>
UnderlineHighlightPainter painter =
    new UnderlineHighlightPainter(Color.red, 1, true);
String word = "the";
int i1 = textPane.getText().indexOf(word);
if (i1 != -1) {
    int i2 = i1 + word.length();
    textPane.getHighlighter().addHighlight(i1, i2, painter);
}
</pre>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The "squiggly" underline has become the ubiquitous marker for cautionary flags in text panes. A decade or two ago it was only used to flag misspellings, but increasingly it's also used to flag grammatical warnings. You could also flag syntactical errors or warnings for a language like XML or Java.</p>
<p>The <code>TextBoxHighlightPainter</code> is a simpler upgrade to the <code>DefaultHighlightPainter</code> that offers a potential gradient or rounded corners.</p>
